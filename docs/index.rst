``docopt``---pythonic argument parser, that will make you smile
===============================================================================

.. note:: since version 0.2 ``docopt`` parses both options and arguments, and
   is better than ever, however that lead to some API incompatibility with 0.1
   line.

Isn't it awesome how ``optparse`` and ``argparse`` generate help and
usage-messages based on your code?!

Hell no!  You know what's awesome?  It's when the option parser *is* generated
based on the usage-message that you write in a docstring!  This way
you don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code, and instead can
write a beautiful usage-message (*the way you want it*), which adds readability
to your code.

Imagine you are writing a program and thinking to allow it's usage as follows::

    Usage: prog [-vqrh] [FILE ...]
           prog (--left | --right) CORRECTION FILE

Using ``argparse`` you would end up writing something like this::

    import argparse
    import sys


    def process_arguments():
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
                description='Process FILE and optionally apply correction to '
                            'either left-hand side or right-hand side.')
        parser.add_argument('correction', metavar='CORRECTION', nargs='*',
                            help='correction angle, needs FILE, --left or '
                                 '--right to be present')
        parser.add_argument('file', metavar='FILE', nargs='?',
                            help='optional input file')
        parser.add_argument('-v', dest='v', action='store_true',
                            help='verbose mode')
        parser.add_argument('-q', dest='q', action='store_true',
                            help='quiet mode')
        parser.add_argument('-r', dest='r', action='store_true',
                            help='make report')
        left_or_right = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=False)
        left_or_right.add_argument('--left', dest='left', action='store_true',
                            help='use left-hand side')
        left_or_right.add_argument('--right', dest='right', action='store_true',
                            help='use right-hand side')
        arguments = parser.parse_args()
        if (arguments.correction and not (arguments.left or arguments.right)
                and not arguments.file):
            sys.stderr.write('correction angle, needs FILE, --left or --right '
                             'to be present')
            parser.print_help()
        return arguments


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        arguments = process_arguments()

While ``docopt`` allows you to write an awesome, readable, pythonic code
like *that*::

    """Usage: prog [-vqrh] [FILE ...]
              prog (--left | --right) CORRECTION FILE

    Process FILE and optionally apply correction to either left-hand side or
    right-hand side.

    Arguments:
      FILE        optional input file
      CORRECTION  correction angle, needs FILE, --left or --right to be present

    Options:
      -h --help
      -v       verbose mode
      -q       quiet mode
      -r       make report
      --left   use left-hand side
      --right  use right-hand side

    """
    from docopt import docopt


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        options, arguments = docopt(__doc__)  # parse arguments based on docstring above

Almost magic! The option parser is generated based on docstring above, that you
pass to ``docopt`` function.  ``docopt`` parses the usage-pattern
(``"Usage: ..."``) and options-description (lines starting with dash ``-``) and
ensures that program invocation matches the ussage-pattern; it parses both
options and arguments based on that. The basic idea is that
*a good usage-message has all necessary information in it to make a parser*.

Using ``docopt`` you stay DRY and follow
`pep257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ at the same time:

    The docstring of a script (a stand-alone program) should be usable as its
    "usage" message, printed when the script is invoked with incorrect or
    missing arguments (or perhaps with a "-h" option, for "help").

Installation
===============================================================================

Use `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`_ or easy_install::

    pip install docopt

Alternatively you can just drop ``docopt.py`` file into your project---it is
self-contained. `Get source on github <http://github.com/halst/docopt>`_.

``docopt`` is tested with Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2.

API
===============================================================================

::

    from docopt import docopt

.. function:: docopt(doc[, argv=sys.argv[1:]][, help=True][, version=None])

``docopt`` takes 1 required and 3 optional arguments:

- ``doc`` should be a module docstring (``__doc__``) or some other string that
  describes **usage-message** in a human-readable format, that will be
  parsed to create the option parser.  The simple rules of how to write such a
  docstring are given in next sections.
  Here is a quick example of such a string::

    """Usage: my_program.py [-hso FILE] [--quiet | --verbose] [INPUT ...]

    -h --help    show this
    -s --sorted  sorted output
    -o FILE      specify output file [default: ./test.txt]
    --quiet      print less text
    --verbose    print more text

    """

- ``argv`` is optional argument vector; by default it is the argument vector
  passed to your program (``sys.argv[1:]``). You can supply it with list of
  strings (similar to ``sys.argv``) e.g. ``['--verbose', '-o', 'hai.txt']``.

- ``help``, by default ``True``, specifies whether the parser should
  automatically print the usage-message (supplied as ``doc``) and terminate,
  in case ``-h`` or ``--help`` options are encountered. If you want to handle
  ``-h`` or ``--help`` options manually (as all other options), set
  ``help=False``.

- ``version``, by default ``None``, is an optional argument that specifies the
  version of your program. If supplied, then, if parser encounters
  ``--version`` option, it will print the supplied version and terminate.
  ``version`` could be any printable object, but most likely a string,
  e.g. ``"2.1.0rc1"``.

.. note:: when ``docopt`` is set to automatically handle ``-h``, ``--help`` and
   ``--version`` options, you still need to mention them in ``doc`` for your
   users to know about them.

The **return** value is a tuple ``options, arguments``, where:

- ``options`` is a namespace with option values:
    - leading dashes (``-``) are stripped: ``--path => options.path``
    - longer variant is given precedence: ``-v --verbose => options.verbose``
    - characters not allowed in names are substituted by underscore (``_``):
      ``--print-out => options.print_out``,

- ``arguments`` is a namespace with argument values:
    - leading/trailing lower/greater-than signes (used by one convention) are
      stripped:
      ``<output> => arguments.output``
    - upper-case words (used by another convention) are lowered:
      ``PATH => arguments.path``
    - characters not allowed in names are substituted by underscore (``_``):
      ``<correction-angle> => arguments.correction_angle``,
      ``HOST:PORT => arguments.host_port``

Usage-message format
===============================================================================

The main idea behind ``docopt`` is that a good usage-message (that describes
options and arguments unambiguously) is enough to generate a parser.

Here are the simple rules (that you probably already follow) for your
usage-message to be parsable.

Usage-message consists of 2 parts:

- Usage-pattern, e.g.::

    Usage: my_program.py [-hso FILE] [--quiet | --verbose] [INPUT ...]

- Option-description, e.g.::

    -h --help    show this
    -s --sorted  sorted output
    -o FILE      specify output file [default: ./test.txt]
    --quiet      print less text
    --verbose    print more text

Their format is described below; other text is ignored. You can also
`take a look at more examples <https://github.com/halst/docopt/tree/master/examples>`_.

Usage-pattern format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Usage-pattern** is a substring of ``doc`` that starts with
``usage:`` (not case-sensitive) and ends with *visibly* empty line.
Minimum example::

    """Usage: my_program.py

    """

The first word after ``usage:`` is interpreted as your program's name.
You can specify your program's name several times to signify several
exclusive patterns::

    """Usage: my_program.py FILE
              my_program.py COUNT FILE

    """

Each pattern can consist of following elements:

- **Arguments** are specified as either upper-case words, e.g.
  ``my_program.py CONTENT-PATH``
  or words surrounded by greater/less-than signs:
  ``my_program.py <content-path>``.
- **Options** are words started with dash (``-``), e.g. ``--output``, ``-o``.
  You can "stack" several of one-letter options, e.g. ``-oiv`` which will
  be same as ``-o -i -v``. Options can have arguments, e.g. ``--input=FILE`` or
  ``-i FILE`` or even ``-iFILE``. However it is important that you specify
  all options-descriptions (see next section) to avoid ambiguity.
- **Optional** things. If option or argument is optional (not required),
  put it in brackets, e.g. ``my_program.py [-hvqo FILE]``
- **Required** things. If option or argument is required (not optional),
  don't put it in squared brackets: ``my_program.py --path=PATH FILE``.
  (Although "required options" might be not a good idea for your users).
- **Mutualy exclussive** things. Use horisontal bar (``|``) to specify
  mutually exclussive things, and group them with parenthesis (``()``):
  ``my_program.py (--clockwise | --counter-clockwise) TIME``. You can
  group with brackets (``[]``) to specify that neither of mutually exclussive
  things are required: ``my_program.py [--left | --right]``.
- **One or more** things. To specify that arbitrary number of repeating
  things could be accepted use ellipsis (``...``), e.g.
  ``my_program.py FILE ...`` means one or more ``FILE``-s are accepted.
  If you want to accept zero or more things, use brackets, e.g.:
  ``my_program.py [FILE ...]``. Ellipsis works as unary operator on
  expression to the left.
- **Any options** shortcut ``[options]`` (case insensitive, so it could be
  ``[OPTIONS]`` as well). You can use it if you want to specify that usage
  pattern could be provided with any options defined below in
  options-description section and do not want to enumerate them all in pattern.

  .. note::
    It is preferable that you use ``[options]`` shortcut only for command line
    interfaces which allow huge number of options to appear in single usage
    pattern, otherwise it's more advisable to enumerate allowed options pattern
    to provide better user experience.

If your usage-patterns allow to match same-named argument several times,
parser will put matched values into a list, e.g. in case pattern is
``my-program.py FILE FILE`` then ``arguments.file`` will be a list; in case
pattern is ``my-program.py FILE...`` it will also be a list.


Options-description format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options-description** is a list of options that you put below your
ussage-patterns.  It is required to list all options that are in
ussage-patterns, their short/long versions (if any), and default values
(if any).

- Every line in ``doc`` that starts with ``-`` or ``--`` (not counting spaces)
  is treated as an option description, e.g.::

    Options:
      --verbose   # GOOD
      -o FILE     # GOOD
    Other: --bad  # BAD, line does not start with dash "-"

- To specify that an option has an argument, put a word describing that
  argument after space (or equals ``=`` sign) as shown below.
  You can use comma if you want to separate options. In the example below both
  lines are valid, however you are recommended to stick to a single style. ::

    -o FILE --output=FILE       # without comma, with "=" sign
    -i <file>, --input <file>   # with comma, wihtout "=" sing

- Use two spaces to separate options with their informal description. ::

    --verbose More text.   # BAD, will be treated as if verbose option had
                           # an argument "More", so use 2 spaces instead
    -q        Quit.        # GOOD
    -o FILE   Output file. # GOOD
    --stdout  Use stdout.  # GOOD, 2 spaces

- If you want to set a default value for an option with an argument, put it
  into the option description, in form ``[default: <my-default-value>]``.
  ::

    --coefficient=K  The K coefficient [default: 2.95]
    --output=FILE    Output file [default: test.txt]
    --directory=DIR  Some directory [default: ./]
