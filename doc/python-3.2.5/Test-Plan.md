# Docopt Comprehensive Test Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing a full test suite for the
existing `docopt` functionality using Python 3.2.5.  The goal is to verify every
syntax construction described at [docopt.org](http://docopt.org/) including edge
cases and stress scenarios.  Tests will be organised under the `tests/`
directory and split into logical modules that mirror `docopt` language
features.

## 1. Test Suite Organisation

```
tests/
    __init__.py
    test_options.py          # short/long options, stacked flags, defaults
    test_arguments.py        # positional args, repeats, required/optional
    test_commands.py         # command semantics and counting
    test_groups.py           # [] () | ... constructs and nesting
    test_usage_sections.py   # parsing Usage: and Options: sections
    test_parsing.py          # low level parser components
    test_shortcuts.py        # [options] shortcut and -- handling
    test_errors.py           # language and runtime errors
    test_stress.py           # large complex patterns and loads of args
```

Each module targets a distinct aspect of the language.  Existing tests from
`test_docopt.py` will be migrated and extended into these modules.  Shared
helpers (e.g. `docopt` invocation helpers or custom tokenisers) will live in
`tests/util.py`.

## 2. Language Feature Coverage

### Options
* Short options (`-a`, `-b`) with and without arguments.
* Long options (`--verbose`, `--file=<f>`), including stacked short options
  (`-abc`), argument separation (`-oFILE`, `-o FILE`, `--file=FILE`), and
  boolean vs valued forms.
* Option defaults from the "Options:" section and how they interact with
  repeats.
* Counting flags (`-v`, `-vv`, `--ver --ver`).
* Required options and combinations with commands or arguments.
* Handling of ambiguous or unknown options.

### Arguments and Commands
* Required and optional positional arguments (`<arg>` and `[<arg>]`).
* Repeated arguments and commands (`NAME...`, `go...`, `[NAME ...]`).
* Arguments grouped inside `()` and with alternatives `(<kind> | <name>)`.
* Commands as first‑class tokens and mixing with options.
* Accumulation of repeated commands.

### Grouping Syntax
* Optional groups `[ ]`, required groups `( )`, either/or `|`, and
  one‑or‑more `...`.
* Nested group combinations and permutations, e.g. `(-a | (-b -c))` or
  `(go <x> <y> ... [--speed=<n>])...`.
* `[options]` shortcut expansion with explicit and implicit options.
* Handling of `--` to stop option parsing.

### Usage & Options Sections
* Multiple usage patterns and how they are parsed into formal patterns.
* Options specified in the Options section with and without descriptions.
* Options placed outside the official "Options:" section (global/local/other).
* Case‑insensitive "usage:" and multi‑line usage definitions.
* Validation of default values parsed from descriptions and tabs.

### Error Conditions
* Language errors: unmatched brackets/parentheses, duplicate option names,
  incorrect option arguments, malformed usage sections.
* Runtime errors: invalid user input, unknown options, missing required
  elements, ambiguous abbreviations.
* SystemExit behaviour for `--help` and `--version`.

## 3. Edge Cases and Stress Tests

To ensure robustness, additional scenarios will be exercised:

* Very long command lines with many repeated options and arguments.
* Deeply nested groups combining all operators.
* Randomised order of options/arguments to verify order independence where
  specified.
* Large default lists and repeated option arguments (hundreds of values).
* Invalid UTF‑8 or unusual character names to ensure parser stability.

## 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Create `tests/` package** with modules listed above.  Provide
   `__init__.py` and utility helpers.
2. **Port existing tests** from `test_docopt.py` into appropriate modules,
   keeping assertions intact.  Where current tests combine multiple features,
   break them apart so each module focuses on a single area.
3. **Add missing coverage** by analysing the docopt language reference and
   examples.  For each feature not already tested, design at least one positive
   and one negative test case.  Consider permutations of group ordering and
   interaction with `[options]`.
4. **Introduce stress cases** in `test_stress.py` that generate large patterns
   and argument vectors programmatically.  Use loops to build long sequences
   and verify performance and correctness but keep runtime reasonable.
5. **Ensure compatibility** with Python 3.2.5 by running the suite under that
   interpreter and modern versions.  Add `tox` environments if necessary.
6. **Automate execution** via `pytest` and update `tox.ini` accordingly.  The
   test plan expects all modules to be collected automatically by pytest.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

The resulting test suite will provide comprehensive coverage of docopt’s
language features, ensure correct parsing and matching semantics, and guard
against regressions.  By structuring tests by feature, future contributors can
locate and extend relevant cases easily.  Stress scenarios will confirm that
behaviour remains stable under heavy loads and complex usage strings.
