Isn't it awesome how `optparse` and `argparse` generate help messages
based on your code?!

*Hell no!*  You know what's awesome?  It's when the option parser *is* generated
based on the beautiful help message that you write yourself!  This way
you don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code, and instead can
write only the help message--*the way you want it*.

`docopt` helps you create most beautiful command-line interfaces *easily*:

```python
"""Naval Fate.

Usage:
  naval_fate.py ship new <name>...
  naval_fate.py ship <name> move <x> <y> [--speed=<kn>]
  naval_fate.py ship shoot <x> <y>
  naval_fate.py mine (set|remove) <x> <y> [--moored|--drifting]
  naval_fate.py -h | --help
  naval_fate.py --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.
  --speed=<kn>  Speed in knots [default: 10].
  --moored      Moored (anchored) mine.
  --drifting    Drifting mine.

"""
from docopt import docopt


if __name__ == '__main__':
    arguments = docopt(__doc__, version='Naval Fate 2.0')
    print(arguments)
```

Beat that! The option parser is generated based on the docstring above that is
passed to `docopt` function.  `docopt` parses the usage pattern
(`"Usage: ..."`) and option descriptions (lines starting with dash "`-`") and
ensures that the program invocation matches the usage pattern; it parses
options, arguments and commands based on that. The basic idea is that
*a good help message has all necessary information in it to make a parser*.

Also, [PEP 257](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) recommends putting
help message in the module docstrings.

Installation
===============================================================================

Use [pip](http://pip-installer.org) or easy_install:

    pip install docopt

Alternatively, you can just drop `docopt.py` file into your project--it is
self-contained. [Get source on github](http://github.com/docopt/docopt).

`docopt` is tested with Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2.

API
===============================================================================

```python
from docopt import docopt

arguments = docopt(doc, argv=sys.argv[1:], help=True, version=None)
```

`docopt` takes 1 required and 3 optional arguments:

- `doc` could be a module docstring (`__doc__`) or some other string that
  contains a **help message** that will be
  parsed to create the option parser.  The simple rules of how to write such a
  help message are given in next sections.
  Here is a quick example of such a string::

```python
"""Usage: my_program.py [-hso FILE] [--quiet | --verbose] [INPUT ...]

-h --help    show this
-s --sorted  sorted output
-o FILE      specify output file [default: ./test.txt]
--quiet      print less text
--verbose    print more text

"""
```

- `argv` is an optional argument vector; by default it is the argument vector
  passed to your program (`sys.argv[1:]`). You can supply it with the list of
  strings (similar to `sys.argv`) e.g. `['--verbose', '-o', 'hai.txt']`.

- `help`, by default `True`, specifies whether the parser should
  automatically print the help message (supplied as `doc`) and terminate,
  in case `-h` or `--help` option is encountered (options should exist
  in usage pattern, more on that below). If you want to handle
  `-h` or `--help` options manually (as other options), set
  `help=False`.

- `version`, by default `None`, is an optional argument that specifies the
  version of your program. If supplied, then, (assuming `--version` option
  is mentioned in usage pattern) when parser encounters the
  `--version` option, it will print the supplied version and terminate.
  `version` could be any printable object, but most likely a string,
  e.g. `"2.1.0rc1"`.

Note, when `docopt` is set to automatically handle `-h`, `--help` and
`--version` options, you still need to mention them in usage pattern for
this to work. Also, for your users to know about them.

The **return** value is just a dictionary with options, arguments and commands,
with keys spelled exactly like in a help message
(long versions of options are given priority). For example, if you invoke
the top example as::

    naval_fate.py ship Guardian move 100 150 --speed=15

the return dictionary will be::

```python
{'--drifting': False,    'mine': False,
 '--help': False,        'move': True,
 '--moored': False,      'new': False,
 '--speed': '15',        'remove': False,
 '--version': False,     'set': False,
 '<name>': ['Guardian'], 'ship': True,
 '<x>': '100',           'shoot': False,
 '<y>': '150'}
```

This turns out to be the most straight-forward, unambiguous and readable
format possible.  You can instantly see that `args['<name>']` is an
argument, `args['--speed']` is an option, and `args['move']` is a command.

Help message format
===============================================================================

Help message consists of 2 parts:

- Usage pattern, e.g.::

        Usage: my_program.py [-hso FILE] [--quiet | --verbose] [INPUT ...]

- Option descriptions, e.g.::

        -h --help    show this
        -s --sorted  sorted output
        -o FILE      specify output file [default: ./test.txt]
        --quiet      print less text
        --verbose    print more text

Their format is described below; other text is ignored.

Usage pattern format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Usage pattern** is a substring of `doc` that starts with
`usage:` (case-*in*sensitive) and ends with a *visibly* empty line.
Minimum example::

```python
"""Usage: my_program.py

"""
```

The first word after `usage:` is interpreted as your program's name.
You can specify your program's name several times to signify several
exclusive patterns::

```python
"""Usage: my_program.py FILE
          my_program.py COUNT FILE

"""
```

Each pattern can consist of the following elements:

- **<arguments>**, **ARGUMENTS**. Arguments are specified as either
  upper-case words, e.g.
  `my_program.py CONTENT-PATH`
  or words surrounded by angular brackets:
  `my_program.py <content-path>`.
- **--options**.
  Options are words started with dash (`-`), e.g. `--output`, `-o`.
  You can "stack" several of one-letter options, e.g. `-oiv` which will
  be the same as `-o -i -v`. The options can have arguments, e.g.
  `--input=FILE` or
  `-i FILE` or even `-iFILE`. However it is important that you specify
  option descriptions if you want for option to have an argument, a
  default value, or specify synonymous short/long versions of option
  (see next section on option descriptions).
- **commands** are words that do *not* follow the described above conventions
  of `--options` or `<arguments>` or `ARGUMENTS`, plus two special
  commands: dash "`-`" and double dash "`--`" (see below).

Use the following constructs to specify patterns:

- **[ ]** (brackets) **optional** elements.
  e.g.: `my_program.py [-hvqo FILE]`
- **( )** (parens) **required** elements.
  All elements that are *not* put in **[ ]** are also required,
  e.g.: `my_program.py --path=<path> <file>...` is the same as
  `my_program.py (--path=<path> <file>...)`.
  (Note, "required options" might be not a good idea for your users).
- **|** (pipe) **mutualy exclusive** elements. Group them using **( )** if
  one of the mutually exclusive elements is required:
  `my_program.py (--clockwise | --counter-clockwise) TIME`. Group them using
  **[ ]** if none of the mutually-exclusive elements are required:
  `my_program.py [--left | --right]`.
- **...** (ellipsis) **one or more** elements. To specify that arbitrary
  number of repeating elements could be accepted, use ellipsis (`...`), e.g.
  `my_program.py FILE ...` means one or more `FILE`-s are accepted.
  If you want to accept zero or more elements, use brackets, e.g.:
  `my_program.py [FILE ...]`. Ellipsis works as a unary operator on the
  expression to the left.
- **[options]** (case sensitive) shortcut for any options.
  You can use it if you want to specify that the usage
  pattern could be provided with any options defined below in the
  option-descriptions and do not want to enumerate them all in pattern.
- "`[--]`". Double dash "`--`" is used by convention to separate
  positional arguments that can be mistaken for options. In order to
  support this convention add "`[--]`" to you usage patterns.
- "`[-]`". Single dash "`-`" is used by convention to signify that
  `stdin` is used instead of a file. To support this add "`[-]`" to
  you usage patterns. "`-`" act as a normal command.

If your pattern allows to match argument-less option (a flag) several times:

    Usage: my_program.py [-v | -vv | -vvv]

then number of occurences of the option will be counted. I.e. `args['-v']`
will be `2` if program was invoked as `my_program -vv`. Same works for
commands.

If your usage patterns allows to match same-named option with argument
or positional argument several times, the matched arguments will be
collected into a list:

    Usage: my_program.py <file> <file> --path=<path>...

I.e. invoked with `my_program.py file1 file2 --path=./here --path=./there`
the returned dict will contain `args['<file>'] == ['file1', 'file2']` and
`args['--path'] == ['./here', './there']`.


Option descriptions format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Option descriptions** consist of a list of options that you put below your
usage patterns.

It is necessary to list option descriptions in order to specify:

- synonymous short and long options,
- if an option has an argument,
- if option's argument has a default value.

The rules are as follows:

- Every line in `doc` that starts with `-` or `--` (not counting spaces)
  is treated as an option description, e.g.:

        Options:
          --verbose   # GOOD
          -o FILE     # GOOD
        Other: --bad  # BAD, line does not start with dash "-"

- To specify that option has an argument, put a word describing that
  argument after space (or equals "`=`" sign) as shown below. Follow
  either <angular-brackets> or UPPER-CASE convention for options' arguments.
  You can use comma if you want to separate options. In the example below, both
  lines are valid, however you are recommended to stick to a single style. :

        -o FILE --output=FILE       # without comma, with "=" sign
        -i <file>, --input <file>   # with comma, wihtout "=" sing

- Use two spaces to separate options with their informal description.

        --verbose More text.   # BAD, will be treated as if verbose option had
                               # an argument "More", so use 2 spaces instead
        -q        Quit.        # GOOD
        -o FILE   Output file. # GOOD
        --stdout  Use stdout.  # GOOD, 2 spaces

- If you want to set a default value for an option with an argument, put it
  into the option-description, in form `[default: <my-default-value>]`.

        --coefficient=K  The K coefficient [default: 2.95]
        --output=FILE    Output file [default: test.txt]
        --directory=DIR  Some directory [default: ./]

Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have an extensive list of
[examples](https://github.com/docopt/docopt/tree/master/examples)
which cover every aspect of functionality of `docopt`.  Try them out,
read the source if in doubt.

Data validation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`docopt` does one thing and does it well: it implements your command-line
interface.  However it does not validate the input data.  On the other hand
there are libraries like
[python schema](https://github.com/halst/schema)
which make validating data a breeze.  Take a look at
[validation_example.py](https://github.com/docopt/docopt/tree/master/examples/validation_example.py)
which uses **schema** to validate data and report an error to the user.
